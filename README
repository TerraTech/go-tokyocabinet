Go bindings for (most of) the Tokyo Cabinet database library.

Copyright 2014 ThreatGRID, Inc.

Included are API mappings for the abstract (ADB), hash (HDB), B+ (BDB), and
fixed-size (FDB) modules of Tokyo Cabinet. TDB is not mapped at this time.

The newer Kyoto Cabinet library has separately maintained Go bindings by a
different author. If your software is compatible with the GPLv3 license, you
should use it instead; see http://bitbucket.org/ww/cabinet

Please see the upstream Tokyo Cabinet API documentation for usage.
